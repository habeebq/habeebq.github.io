User Defined Attributes
VHDL supports User Defined Attributes as well. They can be useful are preprocessor arguments for Tools to know what to do with particular symbols.
The only place I have come across it is to tell emulator tools how to synthesize certain registers (RAMs or Registers). FPGA tools may use them as well.
Apart from that, I guess you can use them if you want to write your own tool and pass some obscure information to it.

  :::vhdl
  attribute attribute_name: type;             -- attribute declaration
  attribute attribute_name of item : item_class is expression; -- attribute specification
  
  :::vhdl
  attribute signal_desc : String;
  signal the_signal : std_logic_vector(5 dowto 0);
  attribute signal_desc of signal : std_logic_vector is "The description of the signal";

Now you can write your own VHDL analyzer to pass this information to a document generator!
