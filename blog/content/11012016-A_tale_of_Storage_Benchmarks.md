When I received a new SSD I decided to benchmark all of my drives before I connected it to see how it would far and whether anything would change.
I built my PC a number of years ago, based on Sandy Bridge and it has served me pretty well so far. The motherboard is a Gigabyte H67-M-UD2H-B3 which has 2 SATA3 ports and 4 SATA2 ports. The processor is a humble Core i3-2100 chugging along its 65W of coolness. Its not a high profile build but its a very smooth and balanced one.

So the drives that I have are:
| Drive | Capactity | Connection | Other |
| Samsung EVO 840 (FW: ) connected to a SATA-3 port | 120GB | SATA-3 | FW: ?? |
| Samsung Spinpoint F3 connected to a SATA-3 port | 500GB | SATA-3 | |
| Seagate ST350041 | 500GB | SATA-2 | |
| Sandisk SSD Plus | 240 GB | SATA-2| |

* Few notes before you read through *
I dont really believe benchmarks are a good indicator for general every performance. However, they can be a good indicator that something has gone wrong, if the benchmarks change after a configuration change. This was the reason I was benchmarking to see if adding an additional drive would change the scores. Spoiler alert: they didnt.

A note on the Samsung EVO 840 drive. I bought this last christmas to boost the performance of the system. While I did see better boot times, i didnt see enough boost in everyday usage, and later I realized while this drive will do great benchmarks I dont think it really performs as spectacularly as I expected. In fact I now feel the slower Sandisk SSD Plus performs better.

* Programs Used to benchmark

I used [HDTach](http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/hdtach.html) in the past, however I couldnt export the results very cleanly.
So I found two other reliable programs.
- [CrystalDiskMark](http://crystalmark.info/software/CrystalDiskMark/index-e.html)
- [HDTune Free edition](http://www.hdtune.com/download.html) There is a free version on their dowloads page, keep your eye peeled
