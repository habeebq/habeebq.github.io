When I received a new SSD I decided to benchmark all of my drives before I connected it to see how it would far and whether anything would change.
Initially I built my PC a number of years ago, based on Sandy Bridge and it has served me pretty well so far. The motherboard is a Gigabyte H67-M-UD2H-B3 which has 2 SATA3 ports and 4 SATA2 ports.
