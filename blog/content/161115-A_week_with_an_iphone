Title: A week with an iPhone Date: 2015-11-16 Category: Android Authors: habeebq

I thought I'd jot down some notes as I go through this journey with the iphone.

The overall experience is good mainly as the battery life is pretty good. Car navigation journeys that would have caused my
android phones to overhead and battery go down from 100 to 30, only causes the iPhone 5 to go down to 70. Immediately this helps
me as I am not always worried about getting the phone to a charge port immediately. Its a solid performer, reliable and does what it does.

There are some differences however in usablility.

### Touch
Touches seem to need to register a bit lower than what you are trying to hit i.e. it seems that sometimes the hitbox is lower than 
the actual text or icon. I'm not at all used to the keyboard at all and constantly making mistakes and hitting backspace instead of enter too much.

### Gestures
There is no gesture discoverability and im sure most users dont even know about it. For e.g. hitting the top status bar scrolls all
the way to the top, this is important for pull-to-refresh based feeds.
Also, im not even sure what swiping does yet. Sometimes it works to go back, sometimes it doesnt. I'm not sure if its a universal gesture or not.
The 'Tips' app doesnt help here either, i went through the whole thing withuot learning about gestures. No onboarding at all.

### Icons
Apples own built-in app icons look too dated. They have annoying gradients on the backgrounds, and are a bit complex.
In comparison Google's icons on iOS look great, they are flat and clean.



### Appstore discoverability


### Appstore selection
