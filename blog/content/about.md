It's hard to describe yourself when you feel it is the journey that describes you not your state of being.

Trained as an electronics engineer and currently working as an ASIC designer I consider myself a computer polyglot.
I started tinkering with computers when I was around 12. Since then I've touched hundreds of languages, frameworks, libraries and general computing topics, many of which keep changing every time I revisit them.

For the past few years I have been working on video compression/decompression hardware acceleration and implementing codecs like VP8, HEVC and VP9.


Recently I've done some serious work in BASIC and Java to build Android applications but finally have that a break.

These days my weapons of choice are emacs, a CLI and python.
