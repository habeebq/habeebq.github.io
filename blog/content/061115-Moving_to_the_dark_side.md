Title: Moving to the Dark side Date: 2015-11-06 Category: Android Authors: habeebq

Most people who know me I personally prefer Android, although I've never forced my opinion on someone else as I believe people have different use cases and requirements depending on how they use their phones.

So I've finally decided to use an iOS device as my daily driver for atleast a year and see how it goes. It wasnt an easy decision to make, but hey...lets keep an open mind.

### Devices I base my opinion on
So far, I've had a Galaxy S, Galaxy S3 and a MotoG as my daily drivers.
I have used an iPhone5 occasionally.
Obviously I follow the tech scene, so I read reviews etc...but with a grain of salt.

### What draws me to an Apple device

Engineering done well. I feel that Apple devices are well engineered. All the way from the SoC, to the physical product, and extending to the platform. People say its been lagging behind Android, but well, both of these operating systems have been lagging behind each other, and see-sawing which one gets ahead on features etc. The fact is, the more both platforms copy each other, the more features and options become available to the end user. It pushes both teams to innovate and critically think about their engineering and usability decisions.

However what I like is:

- The Lightning connector. This is how any connector should be, sturdy and unbreakable. MicroUSB was flimsy.
- Battery charge time. In my experience Android devices charge far far slower than iOS devices
- Battery life. No comparison really. Especially on standby.
- Performance. No lag, no stutter. It just delivers.

What I am concerned I wont like:

- Lack of customization
- Usually there is only a single way of doing things
- Settings are hidden in weird places for eg battery percentage
- Design feels a bit dated compared to material
