&lt;p&gt;Trained as an electronics engineer and currently working as an ASIC designer I consider myself a computer polyglot.
I started tinkering with computers when I was around 12. Since then I've touched hundreds of languages, frameworks, libraries and general computing topics, many of which keep changing every time I revisit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few years I have been working on video compression/decompression hardware acceleration and implementing codecs like VP8, HEVC and VP9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've done some serious work in BASIC and Java to build Android applications but finally have that a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days my weapons of choice are emacs, a CLI and python.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
