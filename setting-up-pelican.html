                <p>I used to blog (when I could!) on Wordpress. Wordpress is great and throws in a huge amount of functionality for free, and also has a huge amount of support.
However, blogging on wordpress.com was a bit limited as I could not (understandably) use any plugins and themes. Also, wordpress was a bit of overkill and also written in PHP which isnt something I am familiar with.
So in order to go deeper, I saw a couple of blogs I liked which had a clean and minimal interface and were generated in Jekyll. So started my journey...</p>
<p>Jekyll looked great, it had a load of themes, well supported and good traction. So I installed it, however, the installation wasnt as smooth as I had hoped it to be, partially due to my overzealous bypassing of most of the documentation. Also I had issues in installing ruby, once I got ruby I needed to install bundler, and I realized I need to update them all in different ways. I was unfamililar with ruby and I wondered if there is something similar available for Python, and hence I found <em>pelican</em>.</p>
<p>While Pelican seemed to be less mature than Jekyll, and has less themes, it seemed much more bare, and I felt I could customize and hack it a bit more. There is also Nikola which looks amazing too, but it seemed it requires a bit more support, however it had a similar structure to Jekyll so it must be a good framework too.</p>

<p>Never having done web front end it was a bit of a curve for me (and still is) to figure out, but things like jinja, css, bootstrap werent too bad, but I've had to figure things out.</p>
<p>Installing Pelican was easy and editing the pelicanconf.py to set things up was pretty smooth. What I needed to figure out was how to get both the blog on version control and the blog on github static pages at the same time in a single commit. I eventually settled on a structure where I generate the blog static files in a lower directory (habeebq.github.io) and save the blog content, templates and script in a directory called blog within that. This allows me to update the site in a single commit.</p>
<p>Settling on a theme was tough, and I am still not sure. I got Flex working first (adblock was blocking out the font-awesome icons), but then i moved to pelican-bootstrap3. I modified it a bit, to add wells, and to fix markdown tables by enabling the plugin bootstrapify [https://github.com/ingwinlu/pelican-bootstrapify]. There is a huge list of themes here [https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes]</p>
<p>Besides I am coming to grips with markdown, I hope to be able to comment all my code in markdown and generate a readable beautified document from it.</p>
<p>I also had to figure out that to get syntax highlighting to work, the code block needs to be indented atleast once.</p>
<p>Now that I type this, it seems I havent done much, but im sure it took my a bit of effort to get my flow running, but i think im almost there. Just need to import my existing blog in here and see how it goes.</p>
<p>As an example here is my current pelicanconf.py</p>
